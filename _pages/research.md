## Biography

I graduated cum laude from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2018 where I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science. I worked on an array of different research and engineering projects, culminating in my passion for graduate studies and research. My research efforts took place throughout my final two years, during which I was advised by Professor Scott D. Kelly. I currently reside at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute where I am a graduate student in the Master of Science in Robotics research program. I am associated with the Biorobotics lab and am co-advised by Professors Howie Choset and Matthew Travers, with Professor Kelly also closely involved in my research development. My focus has primarily been on studying, developing models for, and building multi-agent systems of underactuated robots rooted in nonholonomic mechanics that embody the underlying principles of fish locomotion and schooling.
