## Biography

I graduated cum laude from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2018 where I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science. I worked on an array of different research and engineering projects, culminating in my passion for graduate studies and research. My research efforts took place throughout my final two years, during which I was advised by Professor Scott D. Kelly. I currently reside at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute where I am a graduate student in the Master of Science in Robotics research program. I am associated with the Biorobotics lab and am co-advised by Professors Howie Choset and Matthew Travers, with Professor Kelly also closely involved in my research development. My focus has primarily been on studying, developing models for, and building multi-agent systems of underactuated robots rooted in nonholonomic mechanics that embody underlying principles of biological agents coupled through compliant substrates or fluids.

## Agent-environment Interactions Through Coupling Media
Mechanical systems exhibiting nonholonomic constraints can often be of utility in the study of locomotion and coupled group behaviors for biological systems. Many multi-agent systems in nature, for example, are comprised of agents that interact with, and respond to, the dynamics of their environment. In a recent paper, we approached the study of such agent-environment interactions through the study of passively compliant vehicles coupled to their environment via simple nonholonomic constraints. The Chaplygin beanie is a simple underactuated mechanical system that locomotes when its rotor rotates relative to its body. An example of the Chaplygin beanie is shown below. Supported by two frictionless casters at the front and a torsional spring coupling the rotor to the cart, a nonzero displacement in the spring causes undulatory motion.

Though not shown in the following video, the Chaplygin beanie shown is sitting atop a passive platform. In a recent paper, we prove that all initial conditions corresponding to zero net momentum will result in
