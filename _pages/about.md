Hi, I am Blake. I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and climbing, and am academically engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and robotics. If you are interested in my experiences with the former, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a>. If you are interested in the latter, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a>.
