Hi, I am Blake. My research experience has roots in the fields of robotics, applied mathematics, and mechanics. I currently reside at <a href="https://www.resquared.com/">RE2 Robotics</a> (pronounced RE Squared) as a software engineer, solving impactful problems in robotics. My most recent research-based activities involved geometric methods for accomplishing control and coordination for biologically inspired multi-robot systems as part of the research staff in the Biorobotics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a> page for more information. I also enjoy traveling and the outdoors(see my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a> page).

I have also recently taken an interest in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language. See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> page for implementations of various topics in dynamical systems and optimal control, some of which use Julia.

  <p>A three-dimensional fractal called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb">Mandelbulb</a> exists and it is beautiful. I find it difficult to stop eating Trader Joe's almond butter granola. </p>
