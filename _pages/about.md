Hi, I am Blake. I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and climbing, and am academically engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and computer science. If you are interested in my experiences with the former, head on over to the Explore page. If you are interested in the latter, hop on over to my Research page.
