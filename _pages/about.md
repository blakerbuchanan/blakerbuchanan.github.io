Hi, I am Blake. I currently reside at <a href="https://www.sarcos.com/">Sarcos Robotics</a> as a software engineer, solving impactful problems in robotics, typically aimed at alleviating the necessity of humans in performing dangerious tasks in potentially dangerous environments. Much of my work has allowed me to develop skills in various aspects of autonomous robotic systems: embedded software for manipulators, hierarchical state machines for autonomy, motion planning and control, and computer vision.

My research experience has roots in the fields of robotics, applied mathematics, and mechanics. My most recent research-based activities involved geometric methods for accomplishing control and coordination for biologically inspired multi-robot systems as part of the research staff in the Biorobotics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a> page for more information. I also enjoy traveling and the outdoors, particularly rock climbing (see my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a> page).

I have also recently taken an interest in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language. See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> page for implementations of various topics in dynamical systems and optimal control, some of which use Julia.

  <p>LaCroix sparkling water just hits different than the rest. A three-dimensional fractal called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb">Mandelbulb</a> exists and it is beautiful. I find it difficult to stop eating Trader Joe's almond butter granola. </p>
