Hi, I am Blake. I currently reside at <a href="https://www.neyarobotics.com/">Neya Systems</a> as a Senior Robotics Engineer working broadly on the advancement of robust software for off-road autonomy. Most of my time, however, is dedicated to serving as a core contributor on the team developing Neya's Virtual Integration and Simulation Environment (VISE), a high-fidelity off-road autonomy simulator. Prior to Neya, I spent some time at RE2 Robotics as an Autonomy and Motion Planning Engineer, solving impactful problems in robotics, typically aimed at alleviating the necessity of humans in performing dangerous tasks in potentially dangerous environments. Much of my work has allowed me to develop skills in various aspects of autonomous robotic systems: embedded software for manipulators, hierarchical state machines for autonomy, motion planning and control, and a bit of computer vision. I also highly value contributing to research that pushes the boundaries of robotics and AI, and am particularly passionate about optimization-based motion planning and control.

My research experience has roots in the fields of robotics, applied mathematics, and mechanics. My most recent research-based activities involved geometric methods for accomplishing control and coordination for biologically inspired multi-robot systems as part of the research staff in the Biorobotics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a> page for more information. I also enjoy traveling and the outdoors, particularly rock climbing (see my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a> page).

See my <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> page for implementations of various topics in dynamical systems and optimal control.
