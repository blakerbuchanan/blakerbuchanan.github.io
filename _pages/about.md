Hi, I am Blake. I thoroughly enjoy the outdoors and am academically engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and robotics. If you are interested in my experiences with the former, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a>. If you are interested in the latter, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a>. 

I have also recently taken an interest in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language. I have created a series of posts (available at <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a>) to develop my proficiency as well as provide some videos and code for those interested in topics like dynamical systems and optimal control.

  <p>A three-dimensional fractal called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb">Mandelbulb</a> exists and it is beautiful. I find it difficult to stop eating Trader Joe's almond butter granola. </p>
