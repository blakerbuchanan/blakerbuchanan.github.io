Hi, I am Blake. I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and climbing, and am academically engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and robotics. If you are interested in my experiences with the former, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Explore/">Explore</a>. If you are interested in the latter, see <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/Research/">Research</a>. 

I have also recently taken an interest in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language. I have created a series of blog posts (available at <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a>) to develop my proficiency as well as provide some neat videos and code for those interested in topics like dynamical systems and optimal control.

  <p>A three-dimensional fractal called the [Mandelbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb) exists and it is beautiful. I find it difficult to stop eating Trader Joe's almond butter granola. </p>
