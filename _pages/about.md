Hi, I am Blake. I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and climbing, and am academically engaged by topics like mechanics, mathematics, and computer science. If you are interested in the latter of these topics, hop on over to my Research page. There you will find that I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute.
