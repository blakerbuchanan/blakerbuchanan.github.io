<p>Graduate school can often demand late nights and early mornings, giving many of us graduate students a good reason to indulge in the daily cup, or six, of coffee throughout the day. However, I recently made a decision to stop this excessive use of coffee, the thing I have come to really enjoy at pretty much all times of day. As a result, I sleep better, wake up more consistently and at an appropriate time in the morning, am actually *more* articulate, and feel less anxious. Most of these are obvious side effects of reduced coffee consumption, but I will happily be another data point. I do miss that wonderful cup of coffee in the morning and maybe, after the next few weeks of detoxification, I will take up a more reserved habit of having one. </p>
