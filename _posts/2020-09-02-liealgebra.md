<p> 
Throughout my time as a student of both engineering and robotics, I have learned a great deal about the mechanics of systems through the lens of differential geometry. Some of my training was through coursework, while the rest was "picked up" as I worked through interesting research problems that drew on concepts from differential geometry. While coursework provides a necessary foundation to begin research in areas demanding an understanding of such prerequisite material, I could probably argue, at this point in my research career, that one really begins to grasp concepts from a particular mathematical field when one applies them to their research problems. Furthermore, for me at least, an intuitive understanding of deep mathematical concepts is born out of discussing them with other people who can tell you when you're wrong. However, I often feel my understanding of differential geometry is limited, limiting my ability to converse about it. The purpose of this series of blog posts, which I will title <it>Understanding Differential Geometry</it>, will be to explore differential geometry through reading various sources, though primarily John M. Lee's <it>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</it>, summarizing my readings, and recording my questions as I read. The main idea is that this will serve as a sort-of journal for understanding these topics. My next post will comprise a review of smooth manifolds and how they model the spaces on which the dynamics of various systems evolve.
